description: Deploy applications directly from GitHub repositories with automated builds.

import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

Aquanode allows you to deploy applications directly from your **GitHub repositories**. This method is ideal for Node.js and Python apps, enabling automated builds and deployments with minimal setup.

---

## Step 1 — Navigate to Services

1. From the Aquanode Console, go to **Workloads → Services** or at [GitHub Deployment](https://console.aquanode.io/workloads/services/github).  
2. Select the **GitHub Repo** option.  

This opens the GitHub Deployment screen where you can connect your repository.

---

## Step 2 — Configure Source Control

- **Repository URL** → Enter the HTTPS link to your public or private GitHub repository, e.g. `https://github.com/username/repository`.  
- **Branch** → Specify which branch should be built (default: `main`).  
- **Private Repository** → If deploying from a private repo, you will need to provide a valid **GitHub access token** with `repo` scope.  

This tells Aquanode which codebase to fetch and build.

---

## Step 3 — Build Settings

Define how your application should be built and started:

- **Language** → Currently supported: `Node` and `Python`.  
- **Framework (Optional)** → Select from supported frameworks (if applicable).  
- **Install Command** → Command to install dependencies (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`).  
- **Run Command** → Command to start your app (e.g., `npm start`, `python app.py`).  
- **Port** → Port your app listens on (default: `3000`).  
- **Output Directory** → The build output folder (e.g., `dist`, `build`).  

Example (Node.js app):  
- Install Command → `npm install`  
- Run Command → `npm start`  
- Output Directory → `dist`  
- Port → `3000`  

---

## Step 4 — Resource Settings

Select the resources your deployment should use:

- **CPU Allocation** → Number of cores (e.g., `1`).  
- **Memory Allocation** → RAM allocated (e.g., `16 GB`).  
- **Storage Allocation** → Persistent storage (e.g., `40 GB`).  

Optional:  
- **GPU Configuration** → If your app requires GPU acceleration, select from available GPUs (H100, A100, B200, RTX series).  
- Use filters to refine by **provider** (Datacrunch, Voltage Park, Akash) or region.  

If GPU is not selected, the deployment runs on CPU-only nodes.

---

## Step 5 — Deploy

1. Review your configuration.  
2. Click **Deploy on GitHub**.  
3. Aquanode will:  
   - Clone your repository  
   - Run the install and build commands  
   - Launch your application as a service  

Deployments typically take a few minutes to become active.  

Once live, you can view your service in the **Active Services** tab.

---

## Example: Deploying a Node.js App

- **Repo URL:** `https://github.com/example/node-app`  
- **Branch:** `main`  
- **Language:** Node  
- **Install Command:** `npm install`  
- **Run Command:** `npm start`  
- **Port:** `3000`  
- **Output Directory:** `dist`  
- **Resources:** 1 CPU, 16 GB RAM, 40 GB Storage  

This setup launches a Node.js service accessible via the assigned public endpoint.

---

<Callout title="Notes & Limitations">
  - Currently supported ecosystem: **Node.js** and **Python**.  
  - Private repositories require a **GitHub personal access token** with `repo` scope.  
  - Ensure your application’s **start command** and **port** match your project’s configuration.  
  - Logs are available once the service is running.  
</Callout>

## Next Steps

- Monitor deployments from the **Services Dashboard**.  
- Use **Snapshots** to save environments for reuse.  
- Combine with **Scaling features** to handle traffic spikes automatically.  

With GitHub deployment, you can move from **code to running service** in just a few clicks.
