## What are One-click Apps?

One-click apps are pre-built, production-ready applications that can be deployed instantly via Aquanode.

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Access the One-Click Apps Gallery

Navigate to [One Click App](https://console.aquanode.io/templates/one-click-apps).

### Step 2: Select Your Application

Browse through available one-click apps organized into categories:

- **Databases & Caching**: Redis, Meilisearch
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Ollama, PyTorch Jupyter Notebook, ComfyUI
- **Automation**: n8n, workflow automation tools
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Aim

Select the app you want to deploy.

### Step 3: GPU Selection (AI Apps Only)

**For AI Applications**
When you select an AI-specific application, you'll be redirect to our gpu marketplace. Here you can browse and select from available GPU options in our GPU gallery. After selecting your preferred GPU, the configuration sheet will open.

**For Non-AI Applications**
Non-AI applications don't require GPU configuration, so the configuration sheet opens immediately after selection.

### Step 4: Configuration Sheet

A configuration sheet opens as a side panel containing all necessary settings to customize your deployment.

### Step 5: Configure Your Application

#### A. Port Configuration

Configure network access for your application:

- **Primary Port**: Main port your application will listen on
- **Additional Ports**: Secondary ports if your application requires multiple endpoints

#### B. Machine Configuration

- GPU Configuration (AI Apps Only)
- CPU & Memory
- Storage Configuration

**Recommended Configuration**
Aquanode provides optimized default configurations for each application, but certain settings can be customized depending upon selected provider.

#### C. Store Logs Configuration

**Log Storage Toggle**
Enable or disable log collection for your application.

**Lighthouse Integration**
When enabled, provide your Lighthouse API Key to forward logs to Aquanode's centralized logging service:

- **API Key Input**: Enter your Lighthouse API key

### Step 6: Deploy Your Application

After configuring all settings, review your configuration summary displayed at the bottom of the sheet. This summary includes:

- **Resource Allocation**: Total CPU, memory, storage, and GPU resources
- **Estimated Costs**: Monthly cost projection based on selected resources
- **Deployment Time**: Expected time for application to be ready
- **Access Information**: URLs and connection details that will be provided

**Deploy Button**
Click the "Deploy" button to initiate the deployment process.
