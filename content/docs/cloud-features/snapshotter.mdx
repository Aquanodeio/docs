## Prerequisites

Before using backups, you need to configure your storage credentials:

### Step 1: Add storage credentials

1. Go to [Settings](https://console.aquanode.io/settings) in the console
2. Navigate to the **Integrations** section
3. Click **Add Integration** and select your storage provider
4. Enter your storage credentials (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.)
5. Save the configuration



## Enable backups on deployment

When creating a new VM deployment:

### Step 2: Enable during deployment

1. Go to [New Deployment](https://console.aquanode.io/marketplace)
2. Select your VM template and GPU configuration
3. In the deployment configuration:
   - Toggle **Enable Backups** to ON
   - Select your **Storage Configuration** from the dropdown
4. Complete your deployment setup and click **Deploy**

Your VM will launch with backups enabled and ready to configure.

## Configure backup directories

Once your deployment is running:

### Step 3: Set up automated backups

1. Navigate to your deployment details page
2. Go to the **Backups** tab
3. In the **Create Backups** section:
   - **Directory**: Enter the absolute path you want to backup (e.g., `/home/user/models`)
   - **Time Interval**: Set backup frequency in minutes (minimum 15 minutes)
4. Click **Start Automated** to begin regular backups

### Example backup configuration:
```
Directory: /workspace/models
Time Interval: 60 minutes
```

This will backup your `/workspace/models` directory every hour.

## Manage active backups

Your active backup paths appear in the **Active Automated Backups** section:

- **Take Snapshot**: Create an immediate manual backup
- **Pause**: Temporarily stop automated backups
- **Continue**: Resume paused automated backups  
- **Restore**: Restore the latest backup to the current directory

<div className="bg-orange-50 border border-orange-200 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
  <p className="text-orange-800 text-sm">
    <strong>Warning:</strong> Restoring a backup will overwrite existing files in the target directory. 
    Make sure to backup important changes before restoring.
  </p>
</div>

## Restore to new deployment

You can restore backups from one deployment to another:

### Step 4: Restore between deployments

1. In the **Restore Deployment** section
2. Select the source deployment from the dropdown menu
3. Click **Restore Deployment**

This will restore all backup paths from the selected deployment to your current deployment.

## View backup history

The **Backup History** table shows all your snapshots:

- **Path**: Directory that was backed up
- **Date**: When the backup was created  
- **Size**: Storage space used by the backup
- **Type**: Manual (on-demand) or Automated (scheduled)

## Backup types

**Automated backups**
- Run on your specified schedule
- Continue until paused or deployment is terminated
- Minimum interval: 15 minutes

**Manual backups** 
- Created instantly when you click "Take Snapshot"
- Useful for backing up before major changes
- Don't affect your automated schedule

## Best practices

**Choose backup intervals wisely**
- More frequent backups use more storage
- Consider your data change rate
- 60-120 minutes works well for most workloads

**Monitor storage costs**
- Check backup sizes in the history table
- Clean up old backups you no longer need
- Storage costs depend on your configured provider

**Test restores**
- Verify backups work by testing restores
- Practice restore process before you need it
- Keep important data in multiple backup paths

## Pricing

Backups itself is free. You only pay for:
- Storage costs from your configured provider (S3, GCS, etc.)
- Minimal network transfer during backup/restore operations

Storage costs are typically $0.02-0.05 per GB per month depending on your provider.
