Once your deployment is running, configure automated backup paths.

1. Open your deployment details page  
2. Go to the **Backups** tab  
3. In the **Create Backups** section:  
   - **Directory** – Absolute path to back up (e.g., `/home/user/models`)  
   - **Time Interval** – Backup frequency in minutes (minimum: 15 minutes)  
4. Click **Start Automated**  

**Example:**  
```text
Directory: /workspace/models
Time Interval: 60 minutes
```
