description: "Store and access deployment logs with Lighthouse integration. View real-time streams and maintain persistent log history."
---

## Prerequisites

Before enabling log storage, you need a **Lighthouse API key**.

### Step 1: Get a Lighthouse API Key

1. Visit [Lighthouse Storage](https://lighthouse.storage)  
2. Create an account or sign in  
3. Open your dashboard and generate an API key  
4. Copy the key for use during deployment  

<Callout title="Note">
    Lighthouse provides decentralized storage for logs. 
    Credits are required in your Lighthouse account to store logs.
</Callout>

## Enable Log Storage on Deployment

Enable log storage when creating a new deployment.

### Step 2: Configure Log Storage

1. Go to [New Deployment](https://console.aquanode.ai/deployments/new)  
2. Select your template and configure your deployment  
3. In the configuration panel:  
   - Toggle **Store Logs** to **ON**  
   - Enter your **Lighthouse API Key** in the field provided  
4. Complete your setup and click **Deploy**  

Your deployment will now automatically store logs in Lighthouse.

## View Real-Time Logs

Once your deployment is running, you can view live logs in the console.

### Step 3: Access Logs

1. Open your deployment details page  
2. Go to the **Logs** tab  
3. The interface provides:  
   - **Connection status** (Connected/Disconnected)  
   - **Real-time log stream** with timestamps  
   - **Search** to filter log content  
   - **Log level filters** (All, Stdout, Stderr)  

### Log Interface Features

- **Search logs** – Search message content or raw log data  
- **Filter by type** –  
  - *All*: All logs with counts  
  - *Stdout*: Standard application output  
  - *Stderr*: Errors and warnings  
- **Log controls** –  
  - *Refresh*: Reconnect and reload recent logs  
  - *Clear*: Clear the current display (stored logs remain intact)

## Log Format and Colors

Logs are color-coded for quick identification:  

- **Gray** – Standard output (`stdout`)  
- **Red** – Error output (`stderr`)  
- **Blue** – Meta/system messages  

Each entry includes:  
- **Timestamp** (HH:mm:ss.sss)  
- **Message** (log content)  

---

## Persistent Log Storage

With Lighthouse integration enabled:  

- **Automatic storage** – Logs are sent to Lighthouse and persist even after a deployment ends  
- **Access stored logs** – Logs are accessible via your Lighthouse dashboard, organized by deployment and timestamp, with search and download options  

---

## Best Practices

- **API key security**  
  - Keep your Lighthouse API key private  
  - Avoid committing it to code or public repos  
  - Rotate keys periodically  

- **Log management**  
  - Monitor Lighthouse storage usage  
  - Costs are based on stored log volume  
  - Apply retention policies to control costs  

- **Debugging workflow**  
  1. Enable log storage for important deployments  
  2. Use real-time logs for immediate debugging  
  3. Access stored logs for historical analysis  
  4. Use search and filters to pinpoint issues

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection issues**  
  - Ensure your deployment is running  
  - Check network connectivity  
  - Refresh the connection  

- **Missing logs**  
  - Confirm log storage was enabled  
  - Verify the Lighthouse API key is valid  
  - Ensure sufficient Lighthouse credits are available  

- **Search not working**  
  - Searches are case-insensitive  
  - Broaden search terms if no results appear  
  - Clear filters to reset the view  

---

## Pricing

- **Aquanode logging** – Free (no additional cost for the interface)  
- **Lighthouse storage** – Pay-per-use, based on:  
  - Storage size (typically $0.0005–0.001 per MB per month)  
  - Network fees for decentralized storage  

Check your [Lighthouse dashboard](https://lighthouse.storage/dashboard) for current usage and costs.

*Lighthouse integration ensures your deployment logs remain available for real-time debugging and long-term analysis.*
