description: "Store and access your deployment logs with Lighthouse integration. View real-time logs and maintain persistent log history."

## Prerequisites

Before enabling log storage, you need a Lighthouse API key:

### Step 1: Get Lighthouse API key

1. Visit [Lighthouse Storage](https://lighthouse.storage)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Go to your dashboard and generate an API key
4. Copy the API key for the next step

  <p className="text-blue-800 text-sm">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Lighthouse provides decentralized storage for your logs. 
    You'll need credits in your Lighthouse account to store logs.
  </p>
</div>

## Enable log storage on deployment

When creating a new deployment:

### Step 2: Configure log storage during deployment

1. Go to [New Deployment](https://console.aquanode.ai/deployments/new)
2. Select your template and configure your deployment
3. In the deployment configuration section:
   - Toggle **Store Logs** to ON
   - Enter your **Lighthouse API Key** in the field that appears
4. Complete your deployment setup and click **Deploy**

Your deployment will now store logs to Lighthouse automatically.

## View real-time logs

Once your deployment is running, you can view live logs:

### Step 3: Access the logs interface

1. Navigate to your deployment details page
2. Go to the **Logs** tab
3. You'll see:
   - **Connection status** (Connected/Disconnected)
   - **Real-time log stream** with timestamps
   - **Search functionality** to filter logs
   - **Log level filters** (All, Stdout, Stderr)

### Log interface features

**Search logs**
- Use the search box to find specific log entries
- Search works across both message content and raw log data

**Filter by type**
- **All**: Shows all log entries with counts
- **Stdout**: Standard output logs (normal application output)
- **Stderr**: Error output logs (error messages and warnings)

**Log controls**
- **Refresh**: Reconnect and reload recent logs
- **Clear**: Clear the current log display (doesn't delete stored logs)

## Log format and colors

Logs are displayed with different colors for easy identification:

- **Gray**: Standard output (stdout) - normal application logs
- **Red**: Error output (stderr) - errors and warnings  
- **Blue**: Meta information - system messages and status updates

Each log entry shows:
- **Timestamp**: When the log was generated (HH:mm:ss.sss format)
- **Message**: The actual log content

## Persistent log storage

With Lighthouse integration enabled:

**Automatic storage**
- All logs are automatically sent to Lighthouse storage
- Logs remain accessible even after deployment termination
- No manual action required once configured

**Access stored logs**
- Stored logs can be accessed through your Lighthouse dashboard
- Logs are organized by deployment and timestamp
- Search and download capabilities through Lighthouse interface

## Best practices

**API key security**
- Keep your Lighthouse API key secure
- Don't share API keys in code or public repositories
- Rotate keys periodically for security

**Log management**
- Monitor your Lighthouse storage usage
- Lighthouse charges based on storage used
- Consider log retention policies for cost optimization

**Debugging workflow**
1. Enable log storage for important deployments
2. Use real-time logs for immediate debugging
3. Access stored logs for historical analysis
4. Use search and filters to find specific issues quickly

## Troubleshooting

**Connection issues**
- Check if your deployment is running
- Verify network connectivity
- Try refreshing the connection

**Missing logs**
- Ensure log storage was enabled during deployment
- Check your Lighthouse API key is valid
- Verify your Lighthouse account has sufficient credits

**Search not working**
- Search is case-insensitive and searches both message and raw content
- Try broader search terms if no results appear
- Clear search to see all logs again

## Pricing

**Aquanode logging**: Free - no additional charges for the logging interface

**Lighthouse storage**: Pay-per-use based on:
- Storage amount (typically $0.0005-0.001 per MB per month)
- Lighthouse network fees for decentralized storage

Check your [Lighthouse dashboard](https://lighthouse.storage/dashboard) for current usage and costs.
