## 2. [DataCrunch](https://datacrunch.io/)

DataCrunch is a European **ISO-certified cloud provider** offering on-demand GPU clusters, inference endpoints, and autoscaling containers, all powered 100% by renewable energy. They offer both fixed and dynamic pricing models, support long-term contracts, and provide access to advanced NVIDIA GPUs like H100, H200, A100, B200, RTX series, and more.

### Key Features
- Broad range of GPU and server configurations (e.g., H100, H200, A100, B200, RTX6000ADA)  
- Dynamic pricing: lower costs when demand is low, adjustable daily  
- Pay-as-you-go + long-term contract options with upfront discounts  
- European data centers, ISO-certified, renewable energy powered

## 3. [Akash Network](https://akash.network/)

Akash is an open, **decentralized cloud marketplace** where compute providers can rent out idle capacity and buyers deploy workloads at significantly lower cost. It supports GPU workloads through its “Supercloud” offering, enabled via the Mainnet 6 upgrade, allowing deployment of both high-density (e.g., NVIDIA H100, A100) and consumer-grade GPUs. Akash uses a reverse-auction marketplace model for pricing and supports payments in USDC or AKT.

### Key Features
- Decentralized, peer-to-peer compute marketplace  
- Lower prices (up to ~80% cheaper vs hyperscalers)  
- Supports a wide range of GPUs—from consumer to data-center grade  
- Stable payments and USDC settlement post-Mainnet 6
