title: Hosting a Hugging Face Model
description: Aquanode simplifies the deployment and serving of Hugging Face models with the vLLM inference engine, enabling you to host large language models (LLMs) and text-to-text models with optimized GPU efficiency and lightning-fast API responses.

<Step>

## Navigate to Model Pipelines

1. In the Aquanode Console, go to:  
   **Workloads â†’ Model Pipelines**  
2. Select the **Serverless vLLM** option.  

Direct link: [Model Pipelines Console](https://console.aquanode.io/workloads/model-pipeline/serverless-vllm)

</Step>
<Step>

## Configure Your Model

Fill in the required fields:

- **Model Repository URL** â†’ The Hugging Face model repo (e.g., `huggingface/transformers`, `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`)  
- **HF Token** â†’ Your Hugging Face access token (required for gated/private models)  
- **API Key** â†’ Custom API key that will be required to access your deployment  
- **Additional Settings** â†’ (Optional) batch size, max tokens, or other runtime configurations  

This ensures Aquanode can fetch your model and set up the inference server.

</Step>
<Step>

## Select Resources

Choose hardware suitable for your model:

- **GPU** â†’ Select from available options (H100, A100, B200, RTX series). Larger models (13B, 70B) require high-memory GPUs.  
- **Memory & Storage** â†’ Aquanode will recommend defaults, but you can adjust for your workload.  

> **Tip:** For LLaMA 2â€“7B or Falcon-7B models, A100 80GB is usually sufficient. For larger models (13B+), choose H100 or B200 with higher memory.

</Step>
<Step>

## Deploy

Click **Deploy**.  
Your deployment may take a few minutes while Aquanode:  
- Pulls the Hugging Face model weights  
- Sets up the vLLM runtime  
- Allocates your selected GPU  

Once active, your service will appear in the **Active Deployments** list.

</Step>
<Step>

## Use the API

After deployment, you will receive a unique **endpoint URL**.  

You can make requests to it using your API key:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.aquanode.io/v1/deployments/<deployment-id>/predict" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "inputs": "Write me a haiku about Aquanode and GPUs"
  }'
````

The service will return a JSON response with your modelâ€™s output.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Notes & Best Practices

* Ensure your Hugging Face token has **read permissions** for gated/private models.
* Use GPUs with **sufficient memory** to avoid out-of-memory errors.
* For production use, monitor GPU utilization and autoscale when needed.
* Secure your API key, treat it like a password.

---

## Next Steps

* Use **Snapshots** to save your environment for reuse.
* Combine multiple Hugging Face deployments with other **Aquanode services** for end-to-end ML workflows.

ðŸŽ‰ **Youâ€™re all set!**
Your Hugging Face model is now live on Aquanode, powered by vLLM and GPU acceleration.
