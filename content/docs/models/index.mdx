---

Deploy pre-configured AI and machine learning models for inference on Aquanode's inference platform. Access popular models with GPU acceleration and scalable compute resources.

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Access the Models Gallery

Navigate to [Inference](https://console.aquanode.io/workloads/inference).

### Step 2: Select Your Model

Browse through available pre-configured models organized by category:

- **Language Models**: OpenAI OSS 20B, Deepseek, Gemma, Llama, Phi
- **Image Generation**: Flux Kontext, Flux Dev, Flux Krea, Cogview
- **Computer Vision**: Qwen 2.5 VL, YOLO, ResNet, object detection models

Select the model you want to deploy.

### Step 3: GPU Selection

After selecting a model, you'll be redirected to a GPU selection page where you can choose from a wide range of GPU providers and configurations. Each provider offers different GPU types with specific configurations optimized for model inference.

Browse the GPU gallery and select the GPU that best matches your performance and budget requirements.

### Step 4: Configuration Sheet

A configuration sheet opens as a side panel containing all necessary settings to customize your model deployment.

### Step 5: Configure Your Model

#### A. Port Configuration

Configure network access for your model API:

- **Primary Port**: Main port for model API endpoints
- **Additional Ports**: Secondary ports if needed for monitoring or management

#### B. Machine Configuration

- GPU Configuration (AI Apps Only)
- CPU & Memory
- Storage Configuration

Aquanode provides optimized default configurations for each model based on requirements and performance testing, but certain settings can be customized depending upon selected provider.

### Step 6: Deploy Your Model

Review your configuration summary including:

- **Resource Allocation**: Total GPU, CPU, memory, and storage
- **Estimated Costs**: Monthly cost projection

Click the "Deploy" button to initiate deployment.
