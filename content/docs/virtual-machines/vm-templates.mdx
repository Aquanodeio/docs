title: VM Templates
description: Launch a pre-configured VM in seconds, no setup needed.
---

You can quickly launch a **pre-configured Virtual Machine (VM)** from a set of ready-to-use templates. These templates save you time by providing a secure base system or pre-installed environments for machine learning and development.

Explore the available templates here: [VM Templates Console](https://console.aquanode.io/templates/vm)

## How it works

Pre-configured VMs run as containers with VM-like functionality:
- **Full SSH access** – Connect with your preferred terminal or IDE
- **Persistent storage** – Your data persists across sessions
- **GPU support** – Available on compatible templates
- **Container efficiency** – Faster startup than traditional VMs

## Operating System Templates

### Ubuntu VM
Lightweight **Ubuntu Linux VM** with full SSH access. Ideal for configuring your own stack from scratch.

### Alpine VM
Minimal **Alpine Linux VM** with SSH access. Optimized for low resource usage and custom configurations.

### Debian VM
Stable **Debian Linux VM** with SSH access. Suitable for production environments and enterprise applications.

### CentOS VM
Enterprise-grade **CentOS Linux VM** with SSH access. Best for Red Hat-based deployments and workloads requiring CentOS compatibility.

### Fedora VM
Modern **Fedora Linux VM** with SSH access. A good choice for cutting-edge development, testing, and package availability.

### Arch Linux VM
Minimalist **Arch Linux VM** with SSH access. Recommended for advanced users who need fine-grained customization.

## Machine Learning Templates

### PyTorch Conda CUDA
A **PyTorch environment** pre-configured with Conda package manager and CUDA support, enabling GPU-accelerated deep learning development.

### TensorFlow
An official **TensorFlow environment** ready for machine learning model development, training, and deployment.

## Next Steps

1. Go to the [VM Templates Console](https://console.aquanode.io/templates/vm)
2. Choose your template
3. Select GPU and resources (if needed)
4. Add SSH key for access
5. Click **Deploy**

Your environment will be ready in 30-60 seconds.

## Key Benefits

- **Faster setup** – no need to manually install base OS or ML frameworks  
- **Full SSH access** – complete control over your VM  
- **Choice of environment** – start from a minimal OS or a pre-built ML stack  
- **Consistency** – reproducible environments across deployments  

---

## Use cases

**Web development**
- Ubuntu/Debian VMs for LAMP/MEAN stacks
- Full package manager access
- Custom software installation

**Machine learning**
- PyTorch/TensorFlow VMs with CUDA pre-configured
- Jupyter notebooks ready to use
- Large datasets and model storage

**Microservices**
- Alpine VMs for minimal footprint
- Container orchestration testing
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## Best practices

**Choose the right template**
- Start with Ubuntu for general use
- Use Alpine for minimal resource needs
- Pick ML templates for AI/ML workloads

**Security**
- Always add your SSH key during deployment
- Update packages after first login
- Configure firewall rules as needed
