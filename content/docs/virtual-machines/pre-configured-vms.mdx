## How it works

Pre-configured VMs run as containers with VM-like functionality:
- **Full SSH access** - Connect with your preferred terminal or IDE
- **Persistent storage** - Your data persists across sessions
- **GPU support** - Available on compatible templates
- **Container efficiency** - Faster startup than traditional VMs

## Available Templates

### Operating System VMs

**Ubuntu VM** (24.04)
- **Use case**: General purpose development, web servers, application hosting
- **Providers**: Datacrunch, Akash, VoltageP ark

**Alpine VM** (3.18.4)  
- **Use case**: Minimal resource usage, microservices, lightweight applications
- **Providers**: Datacrunch, Akash

**Debian VM** (12)
- **Use case**: Production environments, enterprise applications, stable deployments
- **Providers**: Datacrunch, Akash

**CentOS VM** (7)
- **Use case**: Enterprise applications, Red Hat-based deployments
- **Providers**: Datacrunch, Akash

**Fedora VM** (39)
- **Use case**: Cutting-edge development, testing latest software
- **Providers**: Datacrunch, Akash

**Arch Linux VM** (latest)
- **Use case**: Advanced users, custom configurations, rolling release
- **Providers**: Datacrunch, Akash

### Machine Learning VMs

**PyTorch Conda CUDA** (2.1.0)
- **Use case**: Deep learning development, GPU training, research
- **Pre-installed**: PyTorch, CUDA 12.1, cuDNN 8, Conda
- **Providers**: Datacrunch, Akash

**TensorFlow GPU** (2.14.0)
- **Use case**: ML model development, training, deployment
- **Pre-installed**: TensorFlow with GPU support
- **Providers**: Datacrunch, Akash

## Quick deployment

1. Go to [VM Templates](https://console.aquanode.io/templates/vm)
2. Choose your template
3. Select GPU and resources (if needed)
4. Add SSH key for access
5. Click **Deploy**

Your VM will be ready in 30-60 seconds.

## Use cases

**Web development**
- Ubuntu/Debian VMs for LAMP/MEAN stacks
- Full package manager access
- Custom software installation

**Machine learning**
- PyTorch/TensorFlow VMs with CUDA pre-configured
- Jupyter notebooks ready to use
- Large datasets and model storage

**Microservices**
- Alpine VMs for minimal footprint
- Container orchestration testing
- CI/CD pipeline integration

**Enterprise development**
- CentOS/Debian for production-like environments
- Security-focused configurations
- Legacy application support

## Best practices

**Choose the right template**
- Start with Ubuntu for general use
- Use Alpine for minimal resource needs
- Pick ML templates for AI/ML workloads

**Security**
- Always add your SSH key during deployment
- Update packages after first login
- Configure firewall rules as needed
