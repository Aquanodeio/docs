## General

### What is Aquanode?
Aquanode is a **developer-first GPU compute platform** that makes it easy to run, deploy, and scale machine learning workloads on decentralized and enterprise-grade GPU providers. Unlike traditional GPU clouds, Aquanode focuses on **developer experience, orchestration, and cost-efficiency**.

### Who is Aquanode for?
Aquanode is built for:
- AI startups and ML teams needing cost-effective GPU compute  
- Developers who want to deploy models without managing infrastructure  
- Researchers experimenting with LLMs, fine-tuning, or inference pipelines  
- Enterprises seeking scalable, production-grade GPU infrastructure

## Compute & Infrastructure

### What GPU providers does Aquanode support?
Aquanode integrates multiple providers in its marketplace:
- [Akash Network](https://akash.network/) â€“ decentralized cloud marketplace  
- [DataCrunch](https://datacrunch.io/) â€“ European ISO-certified GPU provider with renewable energy data centers  
- [Voltage Park](https://www.voltagepark.com/) â€“ enterprise-grade H100 clusters for AI training and inference  

### What GPU types are available?
We support a broad range of GPUs, including:  
- NVIDIA H100, H200, A100 (80GB/40GB)  
- RTX 6000 ADA, consumer GPUs for lighter workloads  
- Next-gen options (B200) as they become available  

### How does pricing work?
Pricing depends on the provider:
- **Akash** â†’ Auction-based, often 60â€“80% cheaper than hyperscalers  
- **DataCrunch** â†’ Fixed and dynamic pricing, with long-term contracts available  
- **Voltage Park** â†’ Transparent hourly and reserved pricing for enterprise workloads  

See [GPU Types & Pricing](/docs/cloud-features/gpu-types-pricing) for details.
