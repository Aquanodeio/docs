title: Troubleshooting
---

### I cannot log in
- Double-check your email and password.  
- If using SSO, ensure your identity provider (e.g., GitHub, Google) is not blocked.  
- Reset your password via the **Forgot Password** option.  
- Still stuck? Contact [support@aquanode.io](mailto:support@aquanode.io).

### My dashboard is empty
- Confirm you are logged into the correct account/workspace.  
- Check if your team/workspace has active resources.  
- Refresh the page or log out and back in.

### VM deployment fails
- Verify your GPU quota (some providers limit access).  
- Ensure your **S3-compatible storage config** is valid (AWS S3, MinIO, Backblaze, etc.).  
- Check logs in the deployment console for errors.  
- Try a smaller VM size or different provider region.  

### Model deployment doesn’t start
- Confirm your model repository is accessible (e.g., public Hugging Face or GitHub repo).  
- If using a private repo, ensure you’ve configured the correct access token.  
- Check that your Docker image builds successfully locally.  
- Verify the model template supports your selected GPU.

### Snapshots & backups not working
- Make sure you’ve added a valid S3 configuration under **Settings → Storage**.  
- Confirm that your storage bucket allows read/write access.  
- Check for typos in credentials or endpoint URLs.  
- If automated snapshots fail, try a manual snapshot first.

### Billing or usage looks incorrect
- Verify the correct workspace is selected.  
- Refresh the billing dashboard.  
- Remember: prices may differ slightly between providers (Akash, DataCrunch, Voltage Park).  
- Contact [billing@aquanode.io](mailto:billing@aquanode.io) if discrepancies remain.
