title: Storage & Snapshots
description: Snapshots allow you to back up and restore your VM environments quickly and reliably. This section explains how to configure S3-compatible storage, create backups, and restore snapshots.
---

***You can use any s3-compatible storage service, we provided just example of backblaze as it's one of the cheapest.***

***Just use value of your s3-compatible storage service and you are good to go!!***

**You can check a tutorial for getting config for your backblaze here [tutorial](../backups/backblaze-setup)**

## VM Deployment Template

When deploying a VM, you can either **select an existing configuration** or **add a new one**.

> **Note:** You must use an **S3-compatible storage service** such as [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [MinIO](https://min.io/), or [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) (one of the lowest-cost options).

## Add S3 Configuration

### Go to backups

![config-s3](/snapshots/gotobackups.png)

### Choose your provider

![config-choose](/snapshots/choose_config.png)

### Enter your config

![enter-config](/snapshots/config_enter.png)

> **Important:** Ensure your configuration is correct before proceeding. Incorrect credentials may prevent backups or restores.

## Create Backups


If you have made progress in your workspace or want to preserve a known state, you can create backups.

### Automated Snapshots

- Enter the **absolute path** of the directory you want to back up.  
- Click **Start Automated** to enable recurring snapshots.

![create-backups](/snapshots/create_backups.png)

### Manual Snapshots

Once automated snapshots are enabled, you can also take a manual snapshot at any time:  

- Click **Take Snapshot**.  
- A snapshot of the current state will be saved immediately.

> **Recommendation:** Always take a manual snapshot before shutting down an instance.

### Backup History

You can view the history of ongoing backups for each deployment:

![backup-history-running](/snapshots/backup_history_running.png)

Both **automated** and **manual** snapshots are incremental, which makes them efficient in terms of speed and storage usage.

## Restore Backups

You can restore a VM to a previous state using any saved backup.

![restore-backup](/snapshots/restore_backups.png)

### Select a Backup

Choose the snapshot you want to restore:

![chose-backup](/snapshots/chose_backup.png)

### Restored VM

Once the restore process completes, your VM will be reverted to the chosen state:

## Success

Your environment has been restored successfully. ðŸŽ‰  
You are ready to continue working from your chosen snapshot.
