## Overview

Aquanode letâ€™s you deploy GPUs across multiple clouds, with built-in toolings and connector support.

1. Aquanode is free. No fees. No hidden charges.
2. No need for multi-account setup across clouds.
3. Manage billing in one place - supporting both credit/debit cards and Solana.
4. Pause your VM when not using it and resume it later, with all your data intact.
5. Store your backups and data in any of AWS, Backblaze B2, MiniO.
6. Monitor your VM's performance and usage in real-time.

## The Problem We Solve

The GPU cloud market is fragmented. Providers use separate consoles, APIs, pricing models, and access rules, which makes it hard for developers to compare, manage, and optimize compute across platforms.

Most services provide only a raw VM with little or no tooling. There is no native tooling or integration support such as snapshots, backups, lifecycle policies, or connector storage for snapshot data, leaving teams with longer development cycles, more complex setup, fragile scripted workflows, and a higher risk of data loss and downtime.

Moving workloads or recovering across platforms still requires manual conversion, custom storage handling, and significant operational effort.
